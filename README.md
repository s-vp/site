### Coding Guidelines

If you're contributing code, please do your best to follow the conventions established in the codebase already. This makes pull requests much easier to review and merge.

We have generally followed the guidelines set out in [AirBnB's Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), with the exception of using real tabs for indentation.
